# Why-work-with-me
I work at the intersection of cognition, neuroscience, and performance. My specific focus is on how humans allocate attention and make decisions under certainty, and how small changes in information structure reliably change outcoes.
My interest is not in abstract theory alone, but in translating cognitive principles into measurable, applied systems: models, analyses, and tools that reveal why people perform the way they do and how performance can be improved.

# What I work on
At a high level, my work revolves around three connected questions:
- How is attention allocated on constrained environments?
- How do humans make decisions when uncertainty is low but cognitive load is high?
- How do subtle changes in task structure, feedback or information presentation alter behaviour and performance?
These questions show up everywhere but they're often addressed intuitively rather than systematically. I'm interested in making them explicit, testable, and actionable. 

# What I am particularly good at
I tend to create the most value where things are fuzzy:
- Translating cognitive or neuroscientific theory into something concrete
- Analysing behaviour or performance data to surface non-obvious patterns
- Modelling attention, memory, and decision processes at a practical level
- Stress-testing assumptions about how people should behave compared to how they actually do
  I'm drawn to problems where performance matters more than explanation and when the gap between research and application is the bottleneck.

# Current Focus
I am currently developing a larger project around how structured information, feedback timing, and attentional constraints shape performance outcomes, even when the task itself is unchanged.
This work is intended to be directly relevant to neuro-performance, behavioural assessment and applied cognitive technology.
The goal is to:
- Model these effects
- Visualise them clearly
- Demonstrate how cognitive theory can directly inform system design

# What I am looking for
I am not chasing job titles, I'm interested in environments where:
- Cognition and performance actually matter
- Thinking quality is valued
- Ideas don't die at the research stage
